/**
 * This class represents a set of training, validation or testing instances.
 *
 * These instances are loaded from a text file. Each row
 * of the txt file is stored as an Instance object, which has it's values and
 * expected class/output.
 * Each row in the file will have have ':' which will separate the expected
 * outputs from the expected inputs, the values of the outputs and inputs
 * will be separated by commas, e.g.:
 *
 * output1,output2,output3:input1,input2,input3,input4.input5
 *
 * Empty lines and lines beginning with the '#' character  are ignored.
